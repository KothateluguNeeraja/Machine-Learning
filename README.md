⚡ TS Energy Consumption - Machine Learning Project
📌 Project Overview
This project analyzes Telangana State's energy consumption data using machine learning and data visualization techniques. The dataset includes service categories, usage units, billed services, and load across various regions. The goal is to identify consumption patterns, visualize usage differences, and cluster areas based on load and service metrics.

🔍 Objectives
Analyze rural vs urban energy service patterns

Identify high-load areas and unbilled service hotspots

Cluster consumption behavior using KMeans

Visualize trends using Python libraries
